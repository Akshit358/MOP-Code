Hello Everyone,
 
I've outlined the roadmap for the design phase of our website in this text file. Firstly, I want to emphasize the purpose behind this design:
It's meant to spotlight the incredible findings of our data science team. I'd like to clarify why we're opting for a web application over a conventional website. 
Web applications empower usersâ€”they allow specific tasks, database interaction, data manipulation, and support more intricate functionalities.
 
Outlined below are the essential features crucial for our web application, making it a valuable addition to the Melbourne Open Project, even with an 
existing website in place.
 
The Melbourne Open Project empowers our design teams in multiple ways: it provides extensive datasets for informed decisions, fosters collaboration 
among stakeholders, inspires innovative design concepts, enables user-centric approaches, facilitates an iterative design process, and promotes
transparency through community engagement.
 
Here's an overview of the features our web application will incorporate:
 
- Interactive Data Visualizations: Engaging graphs and visual representations for easy comprehension of our data findings.
- Personalized User Experience: Tailoring content based on user behavior and preferences identified from data analysis.
- Search and Filter Functionality: A robust search and filtering system to explore specific data or content.
- Trend Analysis: Visual sections displaying trends and patterns derived from our data.
- Recommendation Engine: A system suggesting related content based on user interaction and data analysis.
- User Feedback Mechanism: Allowing users to provide feedback, enhancing our data insights.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring accessibility across various devices for a wider audience.
- Data Security Measures: Robust security to safeguard user data, especially sensitive information


*Important*
I have also finished the design of the landing page and shared the link below:

This design is crafted specifically for our web app's landing page. I've taken the features we discussed and brought them to life with buttons and widgets
that showcase each one. I hope that this design helps the fellow design team members create their own pages in the same format as the sign-up and login pages,
Data Visualisations page, Trend Analysis page, and a few other pages of Predictive modelling & forecasting, Search & Filter , Data cleaning & Integration, 
Automated reporting system, Data-driven marketing strategy, About, FAQ and Contact us pages.
